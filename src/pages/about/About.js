      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>My name is Jonah Householder. I am 22 years old. I went to college for 1 year for marketing but ended up dropping out. For the last one and a half years, I have been working in digital marketing doing PPC, email marketing, content marketing, and a little bit of web development. I have done the Udacity front-end Nanodegree so I have a little experience with the basics of front-end languages. I am excited for this class and working as a developer because I like building useable and nice looking websites.</p>
